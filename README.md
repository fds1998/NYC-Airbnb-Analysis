# NYC Airbnb Analysis

Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb represent a few examples of the dominant companies in the sharing economy for
the transportation and accommodation sector. Most notably, Airbnb provides a world-wide network of
accommodations, facilitating tourist trips and temporary shelters otherwise not available to the public. In
order to quell concerns of safety of entering an unknown host’s accommodations, Airbnb encourages hosts
to provide substantial information surrounding their listings as well their own personal characteristics via
written descriptions and images. Through this approach of providing information, however, potential tenants
may experience an unconscious bias in selecting which listings to choose. Our paper will delve into visual
analysis to explore some geographical relationships with price as well as model building through multiple
linear regression, LASSO, and random forest and classification through Logisitic Regression to gain insights
on what influences the listing’s price and price level.
